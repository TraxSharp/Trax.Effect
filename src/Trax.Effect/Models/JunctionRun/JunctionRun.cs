/// <remarks>
/// Written by <c>AddJunctionEvents</c> from the same events it publishes, so a finished run's
/// timeline, and the steps of a running one a late subscriber missed, can be read back. A junction's
/// row is written when it starts and updated when it ends. The rows are written off the run's path,
/// in order, by a background writer, so they can trail the live events by moments, and a row is
/// dropped rather than holding up the run when the writer falls behind or the database is down.

/// <para>A row never holds a junction's input or output, the train's input or output, or anything a
/// decider was shown: only names, times, states, how a failure is classified and the type of its
/// exception, and for a question the answer the run acted on. An answer to a question about a type
