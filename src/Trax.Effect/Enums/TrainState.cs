/// The TrainState enum is used to track the current state of a train
/// in the metadata tracking system. It provides a standardized way to
/// represent the train's progress and outcome.
///
/// This enum is particularly important for:
/// 1. Filtering trains by state in reporting and monitoring tools
/// 2. Determining which trains need attention (e.g., failed trains)
/// 3. Understanding the overall health of the train system
/// 4. Tracking the progress of long-running trains
/// </remarks>
/// <remarks>
/// The values are pinned because SQLite stores the integer, and its dispatch SQL and partial
/// indexes compare against it; reordering the members would silently change what they match.
