/// <para>It carries names, times, states and how a failure is classified, and nothing a run was
/// given or produced: never a junction's input or output, the train's input or output, a failure's
/// message, or the state a decider was shown. A question's answer is summarised as the option, score
/// or probability the run acted on, and is left out, with <see cref="AnswerWithheld"/> set, when the

/// The junction's class name without its namespace, or for a question or a track, the question's key.

/// Milliseconds from <paramref name="StartedAt"/> to <paramref name="EndedAt"/>, or null for a start.
/// </param>
/// <param name="FailureClass">
/// How a failed junction's failure is classified, decided as the run's own failure would be; null
/// unless the junction failed.
/// </param>
/// <param name="FailureException">
/// The type name of the exception a junction failed or was cancelled with, never its message.

/// <param name="Answer">
/// The answer the run acted on: an option's name, a score or a probability of yes (invariant

/// For any step, the <paramref name="Position"/> of the latest routing step (a <c>Route</c>) the run
/// took before it, or null when no routing step has run yet. Trax.Core reports where a track
