/// <para>A decision is written before the train acts on it, through a data context of its own,
/// so a run that dies mid-way (an OOM kill, a timeout, a deploy) leaves every decision it acted on
/// behind for its requeue to replay, and the write never flushes or inherits what the run's own
/// junctions have tracked. The journal is <see cref="Required"/>: a decision that cannot be written
/// fails its step before any track is taken, classified transient, because a database that is down
/// now may not be on a retry. A value the store refuses is classified permanent.</para>
///
/// <para>The journal itself holds nothing between runs. Each run's row and replayed answers live
/// on the run's own async flow, set by <c>ServiceTrain.Run</c> when it starts and dropped when its
/// junctions finish, so two runs that share an external id each write under their own row and
/// replay their own answers, and nothing is left behind however a run ends. A decision made
/// outside a service train's run, or in a run that was never persisted, is logged only. One the
/// run's own train reports under an external id other than the run's, because the train's
/// <c>ExternalId</c> was changed while it ran, fails its step, classified permanent, rather than
/// going unrecorded.</para>
///
/// <para>Code inside a run can lose the run's async flow, by suppressing
/// <see cref="ExecutionContext"/> flow, say, so a decision, refusal, routing or replay lookup can
/// arrive with no run on its flow. One reported by a train that has begun a recorded run on this
/// host is then looked up by its external id: when exactly one run of that train is in progress
/// under it, it is recorded against, or replayed from, that run. Otherwise it is logged only, as
